Extended License (IStockPhoto)

This is a license agreement between you and iStock that explains how you can use photos, illustrations, vectors, video clips and Music that you license from iStock. By downloading content from iStock, you accept the terms of this agreement.

Copyright (c) 2018-2022 Grandfailure ID: 1062560102

For purposes of this agreement, "use" means to copy, reproduce, modify, edit, synchronize, perform, display, broadcast, publish, or otherwise make use of.

You may use content in any way that is not restricted (see Restricted Uses below). Subject to those restrictions and the rest of the terms of this agreement, the rights granted to you by iStock are:
Perpetual, meaning there is no expiration or end date on your rights to use the content downloaded during your agreement.
Non-exclusive, meaning that you do not have exclusive rights to use the content. iStock can license the same content to other customers.
Worldwide, meaning content can be used in any geographic territory.
Unlimited, meaning you can use the content in an unlimited number of projects and in any media.

Restricted Uses:
No Unlawful Use.
You may not use content in a pornographic, defamatory or other unlawful manner, or in violation of any applicable regulations or industry codes.

No Commercial Use of "Editorial Use Only" Content.
You may not use content marked "editorial use only" for any commercial, promotional, advertorial, endorsement, advertising, gambling/betting/gaming uses or merchandising purpose.
This type of content is not model or property released and is primarily intended to be used for editorial purposes, meaning descriptive purposes such as news reporting and discussion of current events or other human interest topics (for example, in a blog, textbook, newspaper or magazine article).

No Standalone File Use. You may not use content in any way that allows others to download, extract, or redistribute content as a standalone file (meaning just the content file itself, separate from the project or end use).
 	With extended license: Unlimited users within a legal entity. Can save content on legal entity's servers.

Sensitive Use Disclaimer Required.
If you use content that features models or property in connection with a subject that would be unflattering or unduly controversial to a reasonable person (for example, sexually transmitted diseases), you must indicate: (1) that the content is being used for illustrative purposes only, and (2) any person depicted in the content is a model.
For example, you could say: "Stock photo. Posed by model." No disclaimer is required for "editorial use only" content that is used in an editorial manner.

No False Representation of Authorship.
You may not falsely represent that you are the original creator of an end use that is made up largely of licensed content.
For instance, you cannot create a painting based solely on licensed content and claim that you are the author.

No Products for Resale. Unless you purchase an extended license, you may not use content in connection with any goods or services intended for resale or distribution where the primary value lies in the content itself including, without limitation, cards, stationery items, paper products, calendars, apparel items, posters (printed on paper, canvas, or any other media), DVDs, mobile applications, NFTs or other items for resale, license or other distribution for profit.
This includes "on demand" products (meaning products in which content is selected by a third party for customization on such product on a made-to-order basis), including, without limitation, postcards, mugs, t-shirts, posters and other items (this includes the sale of products through custom designed websites, as well as sites such as zazzle.com and cafepress.com).
Extended licenses are not available for Music for any of these purposes.

No Machine Learning, AI, or Biometric Technology Use. Unless expressly authorized by iStock you may not use content (including any caption information, keywords or other metadata associated with the content) for any machine learning and/or artificial intelligence purposes, or for any technologies designed for or intended for the identification of natural persons.
Additionally, iStock does not represent or warrant that consent has been obtained for such uses with respect to model-released content.

iStock may discontinue licensing any item of content at any time in its sole discretion.
Upon notice from iStock, or upon your knowledge, that any content may be subject to a claim of infringement of a third party's right for which iStock may be liable, iStock may require you to immediately, and at your own expense: cease using the content, delete or destroy any copies; and ensure that your clients, distributors and/or employer do likewise.
iStock will provide you with replacement content (determined by iStock in its reasonable commercial judgment) free of charge, subject to the other terms of this agreement.
